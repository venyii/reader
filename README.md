# Reader

in development!

## Why?

You may ask why yet another RSS Reader? Well, first of all it is the perfect opportunity for me to try out great open source
libraries like Silex and Doctrine. I was a long-time Google Reader user so I`ll try to create basically the same experience with some
changes here and there ('Watch later', Filters would be great too, and so on...).

I don´t need/want the 20+ like/share options like Twitter, Facebook, ..., so this stuff won´t make it in this app.
